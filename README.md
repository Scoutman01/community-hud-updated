# Description

**Community HUD** (not to be confused with *Community HUD Fixes* by CriticalFlaw) is a Team Fortress 2 HUD originally created by **flame** and **povohat** in 2010.
Its defining feature is the combination of two classic HUDs into a single package:

* **minmode 0** corresponds to **PVHUD**
* **minmode 1** corresponds to **flameHUD**

The original version of Community HUD was last updated in **2011** by its original authors. After that point, the project evolved into a standalone updated version of flameHUD, and the PVHUD component was dropped.

# History

* **2013** - the first resurrection of the hud was made by [Cheezy](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26840), but this version hasn't been updated since.

* **2015** - a recreation of the hud was made by [Kermit](https://www.teamfortress.tv/29891/community-hud-2015), based on modern versions of flameHUD and PVHUD. It was last updated in 2016.

* **2020** - the HUD began to be updated again by [noobynoob](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26667), but has since been abandoned before completion.

The version presented here is based on noobynoob’s work, which served as the foundation for further updates and fixes.

# Current project

The goal of this project is to **modernize Community HUD while preserving its original dual-HUD philosophy**.

Due to the age of the original HUD and the evolution of TF2’s UI system, many elements had to be reused or adapted from modern versions of **PVHUD** and **flameHUD**.
Additionally, **e.v.e HUD** was used as a reference and basis for several UI components.

This project aims to keep the classic look and behavior of Community HUD intact, while ensuring compatibility with modern TF2 versions and HUD standards.
