# Description

Community HUD (not to be confused with Community HUD fixes made by CriticalFlaw) is a TF2 HUD made by flame and povohat in 2010. It combines two HUDs into one: minmode 0 corresponds to PVHUD and minmode 1 to flameHUD. This version of communityHUD was last updated in [2011](https://code.google.com/archive/p/communitytf2hud/downloads?page=1) by its original authors. After that, the HUD was transformed into an updated version of flameHUD without the PVHUD part.

In 2013, the first resurrection of the hud was made by [Cheezy](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26840), but this version hasn't been updated since.

In 2015, a recreation of the hud was made by [Kermit](https://www.teamfortress.tv/29891/community-hud-2015), based on modern versions of flameHUD and PVHUD. It was last updated in 2016.

In 2020, the HUD began to be updated again by [noobynoob](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26667), but has since been abandoned before completion. It is this version that I used as a basis for updating Community hud.

Since the HUD is old, i had to reuse elements from both modern versions of PVHUD and flameHUD. e.v.e HUD also served as the basis for some elements.
