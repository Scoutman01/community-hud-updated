# Description

Community HUD (not to be confused with Community HUD fixes made by CriticalFlaw) is a TF2 HUD made by flame and povohat in 2010. It combines two HUDs into one: minmode 0 corresponds to PVHUD and minmode 1 to flameHUD.

In 2020, the HUD was updated by a certain noobynoob, but has since been abandoned. It is this version that I used as a basis for updating Community hud.
